## Transforms

Transforms are a different type of plugin that are executed when the entire component tree is available.

A transform plugin returns a map of visitor functions and/or lifecycle callbacks:

```javascript
function plugin(state, conf) {
  return {
    '*': (node, cb) => {
      cb(); 
    }
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle

Lifecycle callbacks are functions that hook into events when iterating the component tree:

* `begin` Called before the tree is walked.
* `enter` Called when entering a node before visitor functions are invoked.
* `leave` Called when leaving a node after visitor functions have been invoked.
* `end` Called when the tree walk is complete.

The `begin` and `end` functions are passed the component tree so the signature is always:

```javascript
function(node, cb);
```

For example you may want to collect all nodes of a type and operate once the walk is completed:

```javascript
function plugin(state, conf) {
  const styles = [];
  return {
    end: (node, cb) => {
      // operate on the list of styles 
      cb();
    },
    'Style': (node, cb) => {
      styles.push(node);
      cb(); 
    }
  }
}
```

### Visitors

Each key in the returned map is evaluated to determine whether the visitor function wants to see a particular node, the wildcard `*` matches all nodes. Available node types are:

* `Tree` Visit tree nodes.
* `File` Visit file nodes.
* `Module` Visit module nodes.
* `Component` Visit component nodes.
* `Template` Visit template nodes.
* `Style` Visit style nodes.
* `Script` Visit script nodes.

### Configuration

To configure a transform plugin you can set a configuration object:

```javascript
const options = {
  files: ['components.html'],
  transforms: ['skate'],
  conf: {
    transforms: {
      skate: {/* plugin configuration goes here */}
    }
  }
};
```

### Compilers

* [skate][] Compiles HTML templates to render functions.

### Preprocessors

* [stylus][] Preprocess style sources as stylus.
* [less][] Preprocess style sources as less.
* [sass][] Preprocess style sources sass.
* [trim][] Trim whitespace from inline styles and scripts.
