## Protocols

---

- [Protocols](#protocols)

---

Protocol resolver plugins are mapped to URL protocols and allow the file load mechanism to be extended so that users can distribute and install web components from remote resources or implement custom protocols.

By default a protocol handler for the `file:` scheme is registered by the [load][] plugin so HTML imports can be loaded from the local file system.

To enable a resolver first install the package (`npm i trucks-resolver-http --save-dev`) and then enable the plugin in the `protocols` list:

```javascript
const options = {
  files: ['components.html'],
  protocols: ['http']
}
```

You can now use HTTP and HTTPS imports:

```html
<link rel="import" href="https://domain.com/components.html">
```

Plugin functions are invoked synchronously before the [load][] plugin executes; they allow HTML imports to be mapped to different protocols.

The signature for resolver plugins is:

```javascript
function ftp(state, conf) {
  return (registry) => {
    registry.register('ftp:', FtpResolver); 
  }
}
```

Plugins must register a subclass of the [core resolver][resolver-core]. See the [file][resolver-file], [http][resolver-http] and [npm][resolver-npm] plugins for example implementations.
